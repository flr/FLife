\description{
Lorenzen natural mortality relationship where M is a function of weight, modified to 
explicitly included M as a function of numbers in a cohort, i.e. density dependence

\details{
@details
   
The Lorenzen natural mortality relationship is a function of mass-at-age i.e. 
   M=a*wt^b 

The relationship can be explained by population density, since as fish grow they 
also die and so there is potentially less competition for resources between larger and 
older fish. Density dependence can be modelled by a logistic function, a sigmoid 
curve (or S shaped) curve, with equation 

f(x)=L/(1+exp(-k(x-x0)))
 
where
e  is the natural logarithm base (also known as Euler's number),
x0 is the x-value of the sigmoid's midpoint,
L  is the curve's maximum value, and
k  the steepness of the curve.

Combining the two functions gives
    
   M=aL/(1+exp(-k(n-ref)))*wt^b;

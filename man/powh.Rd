 returns a data.frame with left and right boundaries and mid point.

\details{
Beverton and Holt (1956) developed a method to estimate population parameters 
 such as total mortality (Z) from length data i.e.

\deqn{Z=K\frac{L_{infinity}-\overline{L}}{\overline{L}-L'}}
                            
Powell (1979) then developed a method, extended by Wetherall et al. (1987), 
to estimate growth and mortality parameters. This assumes that the right hand tail 
of a length frequency distribution is determined by the asymptotic length L 
and the ratio between Z and the growth rate K.

The Beverton and Holt methods assumes good estimates for K and $L_{infinity}$, 
while the Powell-Wetherall method only requires an estimate
of K, since $L_{infinity}$ is estimated by the method as well as Z/K. These method 
therefore provide estimates for Z/K, if K is unknown and 
Z if K is known.  

As well as assuming that growth follows the von Bertalanffy growth function, 
it is also assumed that the population is in a steady state 
with constant exponential mortality, no changes in selection pattern of the 
fishery and constant recruitment.

In the Powell-Wetherall method L' can take any value between the 
smallest and largest sizes. Equation 1 then provides a series of estimates of
Z and since 

\deqn{
\overline{L}-L'=a+bL'
}

a and b can be estimated by a regression analysis where 

\deqn{b={-K}/{Z+K}}
\deqn{a=-bL_{infinity}}

Therefore plotting \deqn{\overline{L}-L} against $L'$ provides an estimate 
of $L_{infinity}$ and Z/K from

\deqn{L_{infinity}=-a/b}
\deqn{Z/K={-1-b}/{b}}

If K is known Z can also be esimated

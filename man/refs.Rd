\description{
Returns a variety of reference points based on spawner per recruit (S/R) and stock recruitment
relationships.

$F_{MSY}$ corresponds to the level of exploitation that provides the maximum, derived from a 
spawner and yield curves combined with a stock recruitment relationship, while $F_{Crash}$ is 
the level of F that will drive the stock to extinction. 

Reference points can also be derived from the spawner and yield curves alone. For example
$F_{0.1}$ is a proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and is the fishing mortality that corresponds to a point 
on the yield per recruit curve where the slope is 10\% of that at the origin; $F_{Max}$ is 
the maximum of the yield per recruit and $SPR_O$ is the spawner per recruit at virgin biomass, 
and $SPR_30$ corressponds to the point on the curve where SPR is 30\% of $SPR_0$. In these 
cases the biomass, ssb and yield values are derived by multiplying the per recruit values by 
the average recruitment.
